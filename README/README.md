##question one 
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input 
should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

function part prompts the user to input the total marks
javascript evaluates codes line by line
javascript evaluates the first code checks the given value
//if it the total marks is greater than 79 it prints out grade A
//if not javascript evaluates the next line of code untill the given expression is passed.



## question two

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

const speedDetector prompts the user to input the speed
//function speed monitor user inputs speed
javascript evaluates the input
//if input is less than 70,it prints out ok
//for every 5kms above the speed limit it gives out a demerit
//for example if the speed is 130,javascript evaluates 130 minus 70 divided by 5 and prints out the demerit in points

## question three
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary


preBasic salary prompts the user to input the basic salary
basic salary is preBasic salary minus benefits
#paye
uses the if else statement to evaluate the basicsalary values 
and prints out the value of paye based o the given expressions

#NHIF deductions
uses if else statement to evaluate the the deductions based on the given values

```bash
